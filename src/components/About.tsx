            <h3>Computer Science Student & Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Virginia with a 3.93 GPA, 
              minoring in Data Science with a focal path in Cybersecurity. I have hands-on 
              experience as a Software Engineering Intern at ST Engineering iDirect and 
              Software Engineer at SwiftScore.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about building scalable web applications, working with modern 
              technologies like React, TypeScript, Python, and cloud platforms. I've contributed 
              to production systems supporting satellite ground infrastructure and developed 
              full-stack applications from concept to deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me diving with Scuba @ UVA, playing intramural 
              sports, or volunteering at the Virginia Discovery Museum. I'm also bilingual in 
              Spanish and hold AWS certifications.
            </p>
